EXERCISE 1
The AUC (Area under the curve) of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristisc) curve is used for visualizing the performance
of a multiclass classification problem. It is a measurement for the performance for the classification problem at various
threshold settings. It gives information about the capability of the model to distinguish between the classes.
The model is better when AUC is higher (near to 1).
When AUC is 0.5, it means the model has no capacity of class seperation.

EXERCISE 2
 "A fully connected layer offers learns features from all the combinations of the features of the previous layer,
 where a convolutional layer relies on local spatial coherence with a small receptive field."
